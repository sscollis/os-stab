Incompressible Orr--Sommerfeld Solvers for Channel flow and Blasius Boundary
Layer.  Also bl.f is a spectral blasius flow solver.

Building
========

Should build on platforms with Gfortran.  Start by typing:

make help

Default build is:

make 

Recommended build is:

make USE_RKCK45=1

You can make the Doxygen documentation using:

make docs

Running
=======

The simplest case is temporal stability analysis for a planar channel using
Conte's method and shooting:

./conte < chan.inp

A similar analysis for the Blasius boundary layer is done using:

./contebl < contbl.inp

or the similar

./orrsom < test.inp

Just computing the Blasisus boundary layer alone (no eigenanalysis):

./bl < bl.inp

A spatial analysis for BL is done using:

./orrsspace 
And then type space.inp for input file

You can do a sweep through the stability curve using

./orrspace
sweep.inp

Updated Orr-Sommerfeld solvers for gfortran 

  conte.f     Solves OS for channel using Godunov-Conte shooting
  contebl.f   Solve Blasius and then OS for boundary layer using Conte
  bl.f        Spectral collocation solver for Blasius equation
  orrsom.f    Similar to contebl.f
  shoot.f     Collection of general routines
  orrspace.f  Solves spatial problem for boundary layers

Numerous updates in this version include:

  1. Fixed bug in eigenfunction values at nstep
  2. Improved orthonormalization criteria
  3. Switch from IMSL to LAPACK (need to test still)
  4. Updated to support gfortran in makefile
  5. Added scripts for gnuplot output
  6. Improved some inline documentation
  7. Use OpenBLAS for numerical linear algebra
  8. Works on Mac OS-X (Darwin)

I have updated the following codes to use LAPack routines

orrncbl.f	This finds the neutral curve for Boundary layer and
		channel profiles

orrcolchan.f	Solve Orr-Sommerfeld for channel profile
